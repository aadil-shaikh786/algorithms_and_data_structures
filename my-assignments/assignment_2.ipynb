I also studied the given examples and the diagrams and ensured that I could replicate the expected outputs with a logical approach. My focus was on writing a clean, efficient, and scalable solution. At first, I explored using lists for missing number identification, but I shifted to sets to optimize performance, as their constant-time lookup and removal operations align well with the problem's constraints.\n",
    "- During the presentation and review phase with my partner which was Juan Sebastian Jimenez Valero, we exchanged feedback constructively. While reviewing his solution, I appreciated his clear documentation and attention to edge cases. However, I noticed areas for improvement, particularly in optimization of space complexity and reducing redundant iterations. I suggested an alternative approach using a mathematical formula or summation logic to streamline the code.\n",
